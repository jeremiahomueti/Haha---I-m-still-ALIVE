So next up, we're going to cover some Pseudo classes. 

Pseudo classes are keywords added to a selector that
specifies a special state of the selected element(s).

So we use pseudo selectors to make selections like:

Every item on the list, except x, or except y.

For example, we can select only 
checkboxes that have been checked. 

Or elements that have been hovered over. 

Or every other button, or every 5th button, or every 9th
button, etc.
